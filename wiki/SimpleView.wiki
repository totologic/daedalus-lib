#summary Display debug view for your triangulations
#labels ID-2

Although triangulations are rarely used directly for display, it is useful to have some tools showing them for debug.

===Simple view===

Assuming you have instanciated and populated a `DDLSMesh` object, you can use the `DDLSSimpleView` class to quickly see the resulting triangulation.

example:
{{{
var view:DDLSSimpleView = new DDLSSimpleView();
addChild(view.surface);

view.drawMesh(mesh);
}}}

A default viewport is created for you, you must add it to the display list to see the result. Then call the `drawMesh()` method every time you need to refresh the display of your triangulation.
